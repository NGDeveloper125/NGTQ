Welcome to the NGTQ (Next Generation Task Queue) ecosystem - a revolutionary approach to task queue management in Rust. At its core, NGTQ provides a standardized trait interface that defines how task queues should behave, making it easier for developers to create, use, and switch between different queue implementations.

## The Core Trait
The heart of our ecosystem is the NGTQ trait, which defines a comprehensive interface for task queue operations. This trait provides two primary queue types:

1. ID-Based Queues : Perfect for scenarios where you need to track and retrieve specific tasks by their unique identifiers.
2. Category-Based Queues : Ideal for organizing and processing tasks based on their types or categories.
The trait ensures that all implementations provide essential operations like:

- Task enqueueing with both ID and category-based approaches
- Task retrieval methods
- Queue size monitoring
- Robust error handling through the custom NGTQError type
## Task Queue Implementations
The NGTQ ecosystem includes various implementations of the core trait. Our current flagship implementation is:

- NGTaskQueue Basic : A lightweight, in-memory implementation perfect for getting started with NGTQ or for applications with straightforward queuing needs.
Each implementation follows the NGTQ trait specification while potentially adding its own optimizations and features for specific use cases.

## Bus Services
The NGTQ trait's flexible design allows it to be extended into message bus services. These services implement the NGTQ trait while providing additional messaging and communication capabilities, making them perfect for distributed systems and microservice architectures.

## Open Source and Community-Driven
NGTQ is proudly open source under the MIT License, welcoming contributions from developers worldwide. Whether you're interested in:

- Implementing the NGTQ trait for your specific use case
- Improving existing implementations
- Creating new tools around the ecosystem
- Documenting and sharing your experiences
We encourage you to get involved!

## Getting Started
To start using NGTQ in your Rust projects, simply add the core trait to your Cargo.toml :

```toml
[dependencies]
ngtq = "0.1.0"
 ```
